## Customize the xDS certificate's lifetime

You can modify the lifetime of certificates used for TLS communication between Contour and Envoy by setting `ContourDeployment.Spec.certLifetime`. This field allows you to specify the validity period of the certificates generated by the Contour Gateway Provisioner. By default, the certificates are valid for 365 days.
