## HTTPRoute Timeouts

Contour now enables end-users to specify timeouts by setting the [HTTPRouteRule.Timeouts](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/reference/spec/#gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1.HTTPRouteTimeouts) parameter. Please ensure the value of `BackendRequest` must be <= the value of `Request` timeout, otherwise `BackendRequest` will be set to the same value as `Request`. Due to the Gateway API does not yet support retries, so we only support passing in the `BackendRequest`, but doesn't truly implement the retries now.
